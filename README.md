# Typing Game App built with React.js

Hello and welcome to my first typing game which is also build with React as part of my React studying.

## currently in development and is not deployed

## to run the project:

- Clone the repository
- run npm install from the directory
- run npm start to launch the project on localhost:3000

## This app currently build using :

1. **React.js** - Without Redux. not sure if ever will use Redux in the project.
2. CSS/SASS - Currently everything is stored in one file, using BEM Naming conventions.
3. Node-sass- I use node sass' "watch" script to save the css on the go.
4. Axios - I use axios for simple Quotes Fetch from some API.

### Responsive Design

Currently, the app is not responsive.
I do not plan to fix the responsiveness, the app is intended for laptop+ usage anyways.

#### other plans:

- Add Error checking, i.e checking how may words are mistyped.
- Add CSS Transitions. CSS.
- Refactor the whole code so it follows React's best practices. The code is almost absolutely lacking tsam
